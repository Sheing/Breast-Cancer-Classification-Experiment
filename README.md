# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Experiment

#Abstract
Breast cancer is a disease that in which early diagnosis is extremely important as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. In the past a lot of people are misdiagnosed or diagnosed for breast cancer at a later stage due to insufficient tools to identify the patient's situation. We have taken a dataset from Dr. William H. Wolberg who is from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, and with this dataset, have performed Machine learning classification method on. ​Therefore, we are applying machine learning (ML) classification methods to classify breast cancer patients into benign or malignant risk groups for this datasets by using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifier methods​. The predictive models we are using here are based on supervised machine learning techniques with different input attributes. In this report we look at the statistical distribution of the data along with the different performances of the two classifier algorithms and which of them performs better.

#Data Description
The data for this project was taken from Dr. William H. Wolberg who is from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals in Madison. The data consists 700 rows of just females each with 11 attributes, 10 of which specify the different characteristics of a tumor that was found within the breast of each individual. This table shows what each variable is and the values they can contain.
# Attribute Domain
-- -----------------------------------------
￼1. Sample code number
2. Clump Thickness
3. Uniformity of Cell Size 4. Uniformity of Cell Shape 5. Marginal Adhesion
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size 7. Bare Nuclei
8. Bland Chromatin
9. Normal Nucleoli
10. Mitoses 11. Class:

(2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
We used this data to train and classify already existing observations to produce an accuracy using two supervised machine learning algorithms, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. We also look at each attribute and their correlation to other existing attributes within the data set.
